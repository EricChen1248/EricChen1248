## What do I do
I'm in DevOps/Platform Engineering at InterSystems Corporation, creating developer platforms and automation pipelines for building and testing products used in the Healthcare and Finance industries.

I enjoy writing tools for myself, using mostly TypeScript, Python, and C#, as well as setting up a home server to run an assortment of services for my family and I.

## Previous Experiences
* I worked as a Research Assistant at BU on a Secure Multiparty Computing Library, writing a full-stack end-to-end application for use as a client demo and internal experimentation platform. Check out our work [here](https://sites.bu.edu/casp/) and [here](https://www.bu.edu/hic/research/focused-research-programs/continuous-analysis-of-mobile-health-data-among-medically-vulnerable-populations/fall-focused-research-program-workshop-secure-analytics-on-mobile-health-data-streams/)
* I worked at Google as an intern, working on developing the cost analysis pipeline for youtube service, enabling observability across the platform to aid in management decisions.
