## I am a recent graduate student from Boston University with a MS in CS.
I am a Software Engineer at InterSystems Corporations, building tools for Healthcare and Finance industries to move into the digital age.

I enjoy writing tools for myself, using mostly C# and Python, as well as setting up a home server to store family photos and documents.

## Experience
* I worked as a Research Assistant at BU on a Secure Multiparty Computing Library, writing a full-stack end-to-end application for use as a client demo and internal experimentation platform.
